This is the general guide on how to make a program auto start on a raspberry pi.

1. CREATE A LAUNCHER.SH
yes, you do have to do this. You are not above the law. 

>>> cd ~/Desktop/Penumbra
>>> nano launcher.sh

Inside of that, write this: 

> cd /
> cd home/pi/Desktop/Penumbra
> python3 Main.py
> cd /   # Include this or face wrath!!!

if you want to sleep/wait.
> sleep 10   # in seconds, add to beginning

Okay so now do this crap to make it executable

>>> chmod 755 launcher.sh
>>> sh launcher.sh            # Will test if it works


1.5. LOGGER STUFF
so you can tell where exactly you didn't follow my instructions

>>> cd
>>> mkdir logs


2. ADD TO CRONTAB
yes, you must use crontab. If you time it right, it won't matter what you use. Boots before desktop. 

>>> sudo crontab -e

Add this fabulous line to the end of the crontab list

@reboot sh /home/pi/Desktop/Penumbra/launcher.sh >/home/pi/logs/cronlog 2>&1


3. TEST HOW RIGHT THIS IS

>>> sudo reboot


4. FIND OUT WHICH STEP YOU SKIPPED

>>> cd logs
>>> cat cronlog


5. REMINDERS
- File system and external imports seem to be having trouble being up at this time during the startup. Good luck with that one.
